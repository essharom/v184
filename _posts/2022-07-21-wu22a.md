title: 'ASA-CoroNet: Adaptive Self-attention Network for COVID-19 Automated Diagnosis
  using Chest X-ray Images'
abstract: Computer-assisted imagery analysis based on chest X-ray images plays a crucial
  role in the clinical diagnosis and screening of COVID-19. However, the radiographic
  features of chest X-rays are highly complex and irregular in shape. Moreover, the
  size and location of the lesion regions vary greatly with infection stages and patients,
  thus dramatically increasing the difficulty of COVID-19 identification. A lightweight
  adaptive self-attention network is developed to address this problem, namely ASA-CoroNet.
  It firstly extracts underlying features using a depthwise separable convolution-based
  backbone, then further identifies lesion regions through an adaptive self-attentive
  module, and finally utilizes a homogeneous vector capsule layer to map the obtained
  features into capsule vectors to instantiate detection objects accurately. Extensive
  experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art
  methods and obtains competitive results on limited datasets. More importantly, the
  trainable params of the proposed model are reduced by 7x compared to the state-of-the-art
  capsule network. In addition, we also interpret the proposed model using different
  class activation techniques and confirm the validity of the three components through
  numerous ablation studies.
