title: Temporal Multiresolution Graph Neural Networks For Epidemic Prediction
abstract: In this paper, we introduce Temporal Multiresolution Graph Neural Networks
  (TMGNN), the first architecture that both learns to construct the multiscale and
  multiresolution graph structures and incorporates the time-series signals to capture
  the temporal changes of the dynamic graphs. We have applied our proposed model to
  the task of predicting future spreading of epidemic and pandemic based on the historical
  time-series data collected from the actual COVID-19 pandemic and chickenpox epidemic
  in several European countries, and have obtained competitive results in comparison
  to other previous state-of-the-art temporal architectures and graph learning algorithms.
  We have shown that capturing the multiscale and multiresolution structures of graphs
  is important to extract either local or global information that play a critical
  role in understanding the dynamic of a global pandemic such as COVID-19 which started
  from a local city and spread to the whole world. Our work brings a promising research
  direction in forecasting and mitigating future epidemics and pandemics. Our source
