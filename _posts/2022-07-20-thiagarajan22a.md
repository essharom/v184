title: Machine Learning-Powered Mitigation Policy Optimization in Epidemiological
  Models
abstract: A crucial aspect of managing a public health crisis is to effectively balance
  prevention and mitigation strategies, while taking their socio-economic impact into
  account. In particular, determining the influence of different non-pharmaceutical
  interventions (NPIs) on the effective use of public resources is an important problem,
  given the uncertainties on when a vaccine will be made available. In this paper,
  we propose a new approach for obtaining optimal policy recommendations based on
  Epicast models, which can characterize the disease progression under different interventions,
  and a look-ahead reward optimization strategy to choose the suitable NPI at different
  stages of an epidemic. Given the time delay inherent in any Epicast model and the
  exponential nature especially of an unmanaged epidemic, we find that such a look-ahead
  strategy infers non-trivial policies that adhere well to the constraints specified.
  Using two different Epicast models, namely SEIR and EpiCast, we evaluate the proposed
  algorithm to determine the optimal NPI policy, under a constraint on the number
  of daily new cases and the primary reward being the absence of restrictions.
