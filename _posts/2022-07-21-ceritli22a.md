title: Mixture of Input-Output Hidden Markov Models for Heterogeneous Disease Progression
  Modeling
abstract: "A particular challenge for disease progression\r modeling is the heterogeneity
  of a disease and\r its manifestations in the patients. Existing approaches often
  assume the presence of a single\r disease progression characteristics which is unlikely
  for neurodegenerative disorders such as\r Parkinson’s disease. In this paper, we
  propose\r a hierarchical time-series model that can discover\r multiple disease
  progression dynamics. The proposed model is an extension of an input-output\r hidden
  Markov model that takes into account the\r clinical assessments of patients’ health
  status and\r prescribed medications. We illustrate the benefits of our model using
  a synthetically generated\r dataset and a real-world longitudinal dataset for\r
  Parkinson’s disease."
