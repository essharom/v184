title: Detecting Biomedical Named Entities in COVID-19 Texts
abstract: "The application of the state-of-the-art biomedical named entity recognition
  task faces a few challenges: first, these methods are trained on a fewer number
  of clinical entities (e.g., disease, symptom, proteins, genes); second, these methods
  require a large amount of data for pre-training and prediction, making it difficult
  to implement them in real-time scenarios; third, these methods do not consider the
  non-clinical entities such as social determinants of health (age, gender, employment,
  race) which are also related to patients’ health. We propose a Machine Learning
  (ML) pipeline that improves on previous efforts in three ways: first, it recognizes
  many clinical entity types (diseases, symptoms, drugs, diagnosis, etc.), second,
  this pipeline is easily configurable, reusable and can scale up for training and
  inference; third, it\r considers non-clinical factors related to patient’s health.
  At a high level, this pipeline consists of stages: pre-processing, tokenization,
  mapping embedding lookup and named entity recognition task. We also present a new
  dataset that we prepare by curating the COVID-19 case reports. The proposed approach
  outperforms baseline methods on\r four benchmark datasets with macro-and microaverage
  F1 scores around 90, as well as using our dataset with a macro-and micro-average
  F1 score of 95.25 and 93.18 respectively."
