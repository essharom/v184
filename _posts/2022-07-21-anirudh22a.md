title: Accurate Calibration of Agent-based Epidemiological Models with Neural Network
  Surrogates
abstract: "Calibrating complex epidemiological models to observed data is a crucial
  step to provide both insights into the current disease dynamics, i.e. by estimating
  a reproductive number, as well as to provide reliable forecasts and scenario explorations.\r
  Here we present a new approach to calibrate an agent-based model – Epicast – using
  a large set of simulation ensembles for different major metropolitan areas of the
  United States. In particular, we propose: a new neural network based surrogate model
  able to simultaneously emulate all different locations; and a novel posterior estimation
  that provides not only more accurate posterior estimates of all parameters but enables
  the joint fitting of global parameters across regions."
