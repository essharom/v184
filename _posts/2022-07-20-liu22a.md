title: A Comparison Study to Detect COVID-19 Chest X-Ray Images with SOTA Deep Learning
  Models
abstract: "IBy using a recently released chest X-ray (CXR) image database for COVID-19
  positive cases along with Normal, Lung Opacity (Non-COVID lung infection), and Viral
  Pneumonia images, this study compares the performance of SOTA deep learning models
  in detecting COVID-19 CXR images. Pre-trained deep learning models are retrained\r
  under several combinations of optimizers, learning rate schedulers, and loss functions.
  Our\r study shows that these SOTA deep learning models perform well if the models
  and parameters are selected meticulously. Overall, EfficientNet is superior to others
  especially across different optimizers. Regarding the loss function, the integration
  of cosine embedding similarity and cross entropy is slightly better than cross entropy
  itself while we adopt the SGD optimizer. In terms of optimizer, SGD constantly performs
  well while Adam and AdamW are unstable across different models."
