title: Improving Video-based Heart Rate and Respiratory Rate Estimation via Pulse-Respiration
  Quotient
abstract: Remote physiological measurement, \textit{e.g.}, heart rate and respiratory
  rate measurement, becomes more and more important when contact instrument-based
  measurement is inaccessible and non-preferable under the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-contact
  camera based physiological measurement enables Telehealth, remote health monitoring
  and smart hospital applications. Remote physiological signal measurement has challenges
  such as environment illumination variations, head motion, facial expression, etc.
  We propose a convolutional neural network to jointly estimate heart rate and respiratory
  rate with camera video as input in a multitask fashion, which leverages the correlation
  between heart rate and respiratory rate. Specifically, we propose a novel loss function
  which integrates the frequency correlation between heart rate and respiratory rate
  to improve robustness of both heart rate and respiratory rate estimation. Furthermore,
  we propose a post processing filter based on correlation between heart rate and
  respiratory rate which further improve prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments
  demonstrate that our proposed system significantly improves heart rate and respiratory
  rate measurement accuracy.
