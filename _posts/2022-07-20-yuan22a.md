title: Deep Metric Learning by Exploring Confusing Triplet Embeddings for COVID-19
  Medical Images Diagnosis
abstract: Because the COVID-19 virus is highly transmissible, leading to a worldwide
  increment of new infections and deaths daily, the development of an automated tool
  to identify COVID-19 using CT images has attracted much attention.  Significantly,
  deep metric learning can be deployed to cluster and classify the fine-grained CT
  images, which aims to learn a mapping from the original objects to a discriminative
  feature embedding space. Previous deep metric learning works have been proposed
  to construct various structures of loss, mine hard samples, or introduce regularization
  constraints, \etc. In general, traditional loss functions of deep metric learning
  methods are based on constraining the distance of the triplet embeddings in the
  feature space. Instead of focusing on the previous research directions, in this
  work, we pay attention to exploring confusing triplet embeddings, for the reason
  that confusing triplet embeddings perform a side effect on the majority of deep
  triplet-based metric learning methods. By considering the spatial relation of triplet
  embedding, and conducting theoretical analysis in the feature space, we propose
  an approach to recognize the confusing triplet embeddings and construct a Confusing
  Triplet Embedding Learning (CTEL) method by adding a hard constraint on the confusing
  triplet embeddings. The extensive experiments indicate that our proposed CTEL method
  achieves more excellent performance on two medical CT image datasets and two fine-grained
  standard image datasets compared with many state-of-the-art methods.
