title: Real-time and Explainable Detection of Epidemics with Global News Data
abstract: Monitoring and detecting epidemics are essential for protecting humanity
  from extreme harm. However, it must be done in real time for accurate epidemic detection
  to use limited resources efficiently and save time preventing the spread. Nevertheless,
  previous studies have focused on predicting the number of confirmed cases after
  the disease has already spread or when the relevant data are provided. Moreover,
  it is difficult to give the reason for predictions made using existing methods.
  In this study, we investigated how to detect and alert infectious diseases that
  might develop into pandemics soon, even before the information about a specific
  disease is aggregated. We propose an explainable method to detect an epidemic. This
  method uses only global news data, which are easily accessible in real time. Hence,
  we convert the news data to a graph form and cluster the news themes to curate and
  extract relevant information. The experiments on previous epidemics, including COVID-19,
  show that our approach allows the explainable real-time prediction of an epidemic
  disease and guides decision-making for prevention. Code is available at https://github.com/sungnyun/Epidemics-Detection-GKG.
