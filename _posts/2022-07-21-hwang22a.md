title: Prediction of Mortality and Intervention in COVID-19 Patients Using Generative
  Adversarial Networks
abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic hits worldwide with a significant number of deaths
  and poses a major threat to public health. Accurate predictions of the risk of death
  and medical interventions are crucial for the survival of infected patients and
  the distribution of limited medical resources. Although machine learning classifiers
  can be used to predict mortality and medical interventions, it is problematic to
  employ the methods because training data are limited whose attributes may be missing
  and classes may be imbalanced. To effectively cope with these problems, we construct
  HexaGAN with a hint mechanism to predict the survival of the patients and medical
  interventions such as intubation and supplemental oxygen. In experiments, our method
  outperforms combinations of existing techniques for limited data problems. Notably,
  our method showed about twice higher performance than benchmarks in predicting deceased
  patients correctly. We anticipate that our approach could help provide appropriate
  treatments on time, allocate limited medical resources efficiently, and ultimately
  reduce the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients.
