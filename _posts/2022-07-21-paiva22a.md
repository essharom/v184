title: Characterizing and Understanding Temporal Effects in COVID-19 Data
abstract: Since the global outbreak of the coronavirus 2019 pandemic, hundreds of
  works have been published, analyzing and modeling multiple aspects of the disease.
  Several of them venture into predictive and modeling tasks, such as mortality prediction
  and patient severity scoring, using  machine-learning (ML) algorithms. An important
  limitation for most of these works is the fact that they do not consider the multiple
  temporal aspects of this pandemic, especially regarding disease profile and distributional
  changes over the months. Such temporal effects are mostly due to multiple interactions
  between different and novel viral strains, combined with mass vaccination campaigns
  targeting different groups or patterns (e.g., prioritizing older individuals and
  those with comorbidity first) and availability of different vaccines. These temporal
  effects result in impaired model effectiveness and classification errors. In this
  paper, using a large dataset with over 10,000 patients from 39 hospitals in Brazil
  admitted during a period of more than 20 months, we provide an overview of the multiple
  forms of temporal drift that happened during the pandemic and the magnitude of their
  effects on model effectiveness. Our analyses encompass changes in the severely ill
  patients’ profile as well as how mortality rates have changed over time. We also
  investigate how the importance of different predictive variables change and shift
  over time.
