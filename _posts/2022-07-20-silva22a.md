title: Detecting and mitigating issues in image-based COVID-19 diagnosis
abstract: As urgency over the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increased, many
  datasets with chest radiography (CXR) and chest computed tomography (CT) images
  emerged aiming at the detection and prognosis of COVID-19. Over the last two years,
  thousands of studies have been published, reporting promising results. However,
  a deeper analysis of the datasets and the methods employed reveals issues that may
  hamper conclusions and practical applicability. We investigate three major datasets
  commonly used in these studies, detect problems related to the existence of duplicates,
  address the specificity of classes within those datasets, and propose a way to perform
  external validation via cross-dataset evaluation. Our guidelines and findings contribute
  towards a trust-worthy application of Machine Learning in the context of image-based
  diagnosis, as well as offer a more accurate assessment of models applied to the
  prognostication of diseases using image datasets and pave the way towards models
  that can be relied upon in the real world.
